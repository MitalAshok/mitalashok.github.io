<h1>State Population Flag</h1>
<p>Please ignore the fact that this page is not the best&trade; to look at.</p>

<p>What if the flag of the US had its stars and stripes proportional to the population of the state it represents?</p>

<p>Here is what it would look like (stars in order of admission to the union, stripes in order of when the British colony was founded)</p>

<p>What about the same thing again but for the area of each state?</p>

<p>Here are the same flags again, but animated so you can see the difference with a traditional US flag</p>

<p>And as an extra flag, one that goes between stars proportional to population and stars proportional to electoral votes in the 2012, 2016 and 2020 presidential elections</p>
